# BudgetBuddy

BudgetBuddy is a money-tracking app that helps people keep track of what they earn and spend. Users can enter daily expenses, sort them into categories like food, transportation, and entertainment, and get a clear view of their spending habits. The goal is to make managing money less stressful and easier to understand, especially for beginners.

Built for college students, young adults, and anyone looking to build better spending habits.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

**1. Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shafin-Rehman/product-proposal.git
cd product-proposal
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root folder and add your Supabase credentials:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```



**4. Start the app**
```bash
npm run dev
```


## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses two GitHub Actions pipelines that trigger automatically on every push to main:

- **Backend CI** — installs dependencies, runs tests, and checks code coverage every time backend code changes
- **DB Migrations** — automatically pushes database schema changes to Supabase so no one has to update the database manually

## Testing

### Where tests should be added

Add API route tests in:

```
nextjs/__tests__/
```

Use one test file per feature or route group. Example:

- `auth.test.js` — signup and login routes

Tests target the actual Next.js App Router route handler logic. External dependencies are mocked with `jest.mock()` so no real DB connection is needed.

### How to run tests

Tests must be run from inside the `nextjs` directory:

```bash
cd nextjs
npm test -- --coverage
```

This runs all test files in `nextjs/__tests__/` and generates a coverage report at:

```
nextjs/coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```
